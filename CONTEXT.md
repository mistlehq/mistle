# Mistle

This context defines the product language used for sandbox profiles, snapshots, sessions, integrations, and triggers.

## Language

**Sandbox profile version**:
A versioned sandbox profile configuration that can be published and used to prepare sandbox sessions.
_Avoid_: Profile revision

**Referenced sandbox profile version**:
The **Sandbox profile version** an object is configured to use or was created from.
_Avoid_: Current version, latest version

**Snapshot**:
A prepared sandbox image for a published **Sandbox profile version**.
_Avoid_: Template, cache

**Base image**:
The configured starting sandbox image used before profile-specific preparation.
_Avoid_: Profile image

**Setup script**:
The full initialization script for preparing a **Snapshot** from a **Base image**.
_Avoid_: Bootstrap script, init script

**Snapshot maintenance script**:
The version-scoped, publish-free script for **Automatic snapshot refresh** from an existing usable **Snapshot**.
_Avoid_: Maintenance script, setup script variant, refresh script, update script

**Automatic snapshot refresh**:
A schedule that refreshes a published **Sandbox profile version**'s **Snapshot**.
_Avoid_: Auto-refresh, scheduled rebuild

**Snapshot preparation script**:
The script that a snapshot refresh runs while preparing a **Snapshot**.
_Avoid_: Generic script

**Collection landing page**:
A top-level page that lists existing product objects and offers the primary action for creating the first one.
_Avoid_: Detail tab, filtered results view

**Filtered collection view**:
A narrowed view of a **Collection landing page** based on user-entered criteria.
_Avoid_: Empty state, local table filter

**Trigger**:
A configured event or schedule that starts an agent response.
_Avoid_: Automation

**Trigger event**:
A provider event that can be selected as the event source for a **Trigger**.
_Avoid_: Webhook event when naming product-facing trigger-builder concepts

**Trigger conversation**:
A conversation created or reused while handling a **Trigger** run.
_Avoid_: Automation conversation

## Relationships

- A **Sandbox profile version** may have one usable **Snapshot**.
- A session, trigger, or other profile-backed object may have a **Referenced sandbox profile version** that differs from the profile's latest published **Sandbox profile version**.
- A **Setup script** prepares a **Snapshot** from a **Base image**.
- A **Snapshot maintenance script** prepares a replacement **Snapshot** from an existing usable **Snapshot**.
- A **Snapshot maintenance script** belongs to one **Sandbox profile version** but may be edited without publishing a new version.
- **Automatic snapshot refresh** uses the latest saved **Snapshot maintenance script** at execution time when one is present; otherwise it uses the **Setup script**.
- Unsaved **Snapshot maintenance script** edits do not affect **Automatic snapshot refresh**.
- Saving **Automatic snapshot refresh** also saves **Snapshot maintenance script** edits.
- Disabling **Automatic snapshot refresh** does not delete the saved **Snapshot maintenance script**.
- A manual **Snapshot maintenance script** refresh is available only when **Automatic snapshot refresh** is enabled, a saved **Snapshot maintenance script** is present, and the **Sandbox profile version** has a usable **Snapshot**.
- A **Snapshot preparation script** is either the **Setup script** or the **Snapshot maintenance script** used by a refresh execution.
- A **Snapshot maintenance script** test run starts from an existing usable **Snapshot** but does not replace it.
- When a new **Sandbox profile version** is published, the **Snapshot maintenance script** and **Automatic snapshot refresh** definition should be copied forward from the previous version.
- A **Collection landing page** may list **Sandbox profile version** families, triggers, sessions, or organization members.
- A **Filtered collection view** narrows a **Collection landing page** without changing whether the underlying collection exists.
- A **Trigger** may select one or more **Trigger events**.
- A **Trigger** may start from a webhook event or a schedule.
- A **Trigger** run may create or reuse one **Trigger conversation**.

## Example Dialogue

> **Dev:** "How does **Automatic snapshot refresh** decide whether to run the **Setup script** or **Snapshot maintenance script**?"
> **Domain expert:** "If the target version has a saved **Snapshot maintenance script**, it starts from the existing **Snapshot** and runs that script; otherwise it starts from the **Base image** and runs the **Setup script**."

## Flagged Ambiguities

- "refresh script" could mean either **Setup script** reuse or **Snapshot maintenance script** execution — resolved: use **Snapshot maintenance script** for the lighter existing-snapshot refresh path.
- "auto-refresh" and "scheduled refresh" were used interchangeably — resolved: use **Automatic snapshot refresh** for the product concept.
- "full refresh" was considered for the setup-based refresh path — resolved: use **Setup script** / `setup` when contrasting with **Snapshot maintenance script** / `maintenance`.
- **Snapshot maintenance script** was initially discussed as ordinary versioned profile-version data — resolved: it is scoped to a **Sandbox profile version** but can be updated without publishing a new version or rebuilding from the **Setup script**.
- "Maintenance script" collides with backend maintenance commands — resolved: use **Snapshot maintenance script** in product language.
- A queued maintenance refresh was considered as a script-capturing job — resolved for the first implementation: scheduled refresh uses the latest saved **Snapshot maintenance script** at execution time.
- Copied refresh schedules should keep their definition but recompute their next occurrence for the newly published **Sandbox profile version**.
- "empty state" could mean first-use creation guidance, filtered no-results copy, or unavailable dependency copy — resolved: for collection pages, use it to mean the zero-object state before the first item exists.
- "search filtering" could mean client-side filtering of visible rows or a **Filtered collection view** — resolved: collection pages should use a **Filtered collection view** when the result count spans more than the currently loaded page.
- "webhook event" was used for both provider-delivered records and selectable product-facing events in the trigger builder — resolved: use **Trigger event** in product-facing trigger-builder copy and keep webhook event for integration/runtime concepts.
- "automation" was used for both the user-facing configured behavior and the internal runtime model — resolved: use **Trigger** as the canonical term across product, API, persistence, and workflow language.
- Dashboard URLs are user-facing language — resolved: use **Trigger** naming for dashboard routes.
- Dashboard route parameters are user-facing route language — resolved: use `triggerId`.
- A unified dashboard trigger detail page should not infer the trigger kind by trying type-specific endpoints — resolved: expose a trigger detail read contract and use it before rendering the type-specific editor.
- The trigger detail read contract should return the same summary shape as the unified trigger list item so the dashboard has one discriminator shape for trigger routing.
- Trigger identifier prefixes were considered during the automation-to-trigger rename — resolved: new **Trigger** records should use trigger-named prefixes, while existing legacy identifiers keep their historical prefixes.
- "automation conversation" was considered as a separate runtime concept — resolved: use **Trigger conversation** for conversations created or reused while handling **Trigger** runs.
- Scheduled action target language used `automation_run` while representing scheduled **Trigger** runs — resolved: use trigger-named target types and payload fields.
- The automation-to-trigger rename was considered as a staged compatibility migration — resolved: ship it as one atomic rename, except for explicit durable workflow compatibility requirements.
- "version" was used ambiguously to mean the latest published **Sandbox profile version** or an object's **Referenced sandbox profile version** — resolved: when describing a session, trigger, or other profile-backed object, use the object's referenced version.
